### Notes: 

- Page.paragraph (1 for start of first paragraph)

### Part I: The Programming Life
- 5.1: time and interruption
- 8.1: low vs. high
- 10.3: not real techie
- 13.4: why do women leave?
- 28.2: social people go to management

#### Meeting notes: 
- y2k bug, no one will use it in 30 years (tech debt and bandaid fixes)
- they will talk so badly after you're gone
- culture: 
  - don't talk to each other, no one to help when you're stuck 
  - only speaking to your manager for 5 mins of the week
  - hostile environment
  - talking about the holocast as though it's normal
  - the "oh, I didn't know you were here talk"
- 10x engineer: 10x more productive than lowest level engineer
- bro culture: hard to not fit into that "norm"
- being pushed into management vs. technical
    - the awkward bro can't be a manager
    - but a woman with "soft skills" can
    - the stereotype of that then escalates how others are evaulated/viewed
- does the glue work hold us back from getting to that "senior" level position? 
    - do we just stop doing it? do we get leadership to acknowledge it? do we make it more visible?
- self advocation: 
    - talking about actionable steps to improvement
    - are male leadership members afraid to talk about this?
