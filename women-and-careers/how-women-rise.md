# How Women Rise: Break the 12 Habits Holding You Back from Your Next Raise, Promotion, or Job

## Authors: Sally Helgesen & Marshall Goldsmith

## Part I: On Being Stuck

### Ch 2: Where You Are
- Really liked the Ellen example on page 17 - related to what she was going through and her path there (page 25)
- I know they address it (page 12), but I donâ€™t think that we are the only problems preventing us from moving forward. At what point do we meet in the middle and at what point are we reaching into the male-dominated world too much? 
- defining success and how women need more than just salary and position name - is that envinronmental? are women only just more emotional? 
- is where I want to go coming from others' influence or is it my own choice? 
- habits are us on autopilot, not us as who we are

### Ch 3: When Women Resist Change 
- page 32 - instead of rejecting the critique, we feel bad about it - very true for me, how can I overcome this? how do I distance myself from negative feedback to take action rather than retreat/paralyze?
- stages of resistance for women (page 33):

## Part II: The Habits That Keep Women From Reaching Their Goals

### Ch 4: The Twelve Habits

### Ch 5: Habit 1: Reluctance to Claim Your Achievements
- get a friend to compliment you as practice to how you respond to other people
- "Mistakes Were Made, But Not By Us" - book around psychology on others helping/favoring you
- having your elevator pitch ready for yourself
    - even if you don't know what you want, what are you doing to find out?
    - how can you widen your experience to make sure you're able to make that decision later?

### Ch 6: Habit 2: Expecting Others to Spontaneously Notice and Reward You Contributions
- you need to be the adovacate for yourself (self-promotion needs to be your responsibility)
- you souldn't blame your actions on your habits ("I'm not a self-promoter")
