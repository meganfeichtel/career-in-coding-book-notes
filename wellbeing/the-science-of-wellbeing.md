## Professor: Dr. Laurie Santos, Yale University

## Week 1 

### Key Concepts

* Assess your current level of well-being and produce a baseline measurement of well-being
* Discover your signature strengths and apply them in your life for at least one week 

### Happiness Can Be Learned

Misconceptions of Happiness: 
1. G.I. Joe Fallacy
    * mistaken idea that "knowing is half the battle"
    * meerly knowing something is not enough to change the behavior
    * we need to change habits to change our behavior

### Rewirement Activity: 

1. Measure Happiness
2. Signaure Strengths



## Week 2

### Key Concepts
* Understand that simply knowing is not enough to change behavior
* Give examples of what things wonâ€™t make you as happy as you think they will
* Revise and reconsider goals and aspirations that will not lead to improved well-being
* Practice savoring and gratitude every day for at least one week

### Savoring and Gratitude
* Savoring
    * the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it
    * intensifies and lengethens the positive emotions that come with doing something you love
    * boosts mood by: thwarting hedonic adaptation (remember the good stuff), thwart mind wandering, increase gratitude
    * to enhance: share the experience with another person, think about how lucky you are to enjoy such an amazing moment, keep a souvenir or photo of that activity, and make sure you stay in the present moment the entire time
* Gratitude
    * positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates what one has received in life
    * icrease mood, lower stress levels, increase immune system, lower blood pressure, feel stronger social connections


 ### Things We Think Will Make Us Happy (But Don't)
 
 What are some things that you think make you happy?
 WARNING: The things you thought would make you happy won't.

1. A Good Job
* Gilbert et al (1998) - how do college students feel when they don't get the job they want (scale 1-10)? 
    * fair decision: predicted drop: 2.1 pts, actual: .68
    * unfair decision: predicted drop: 1.9, actual: 0
* Most grads want compensation the most when considering a new job
* What salary is enough to make us happy? 
    * Lyubomirsky - "The How of Happiness" book
    * looked at salaries that people actually have and see the same trend that people always want more (30k want 50k, 100k want 250k)
    * what we think we need jumps up every time we get more
2. Money
* Stat: US lottery spending in 2016 - $70 billion (more than books, movies, video games, combined)
* American Freshman Survey (2005) - sampled from 1967 through 2005, how much does $ matter; asked: what's very important in life? 
    * "well off" - 71% (2005), 42% (1967)
    * develop meaningful philosophy - 52% (2005), 86% (1967)
* Does money make us happier? Ed Diener - "Happiness" book
    * correlation for as income goes up, does life satisfaction go up? .1 correlation, so not very strong impact
    * by country: if in poor nation, life satisfaction does go up; but in a wealthy nation, not really seeing any correlations
* getting more access to things doesn't really increase happiness, necessarily
* Kahneman and Deaton
    * is there a threshold where there is/isn't a bump in happiness? 
        * sampled over American population and looked at positive affects (smiling), not blue (not feeling anxious/sad), stress-free
        * lowest incomes get better and better, but threshold is around $75,000 (at which $ stops impacting emotional well-being (EWB))
    * also measured "life evaluation" - scale from 0 to 10
        * this continues to go up with more income
    * our own life evaluation goes up regardless of our happiness the more money we make
3. Awesome Stuff
* Nickerson et al. (2003) - wanting stuff can actually make us worse off, materialists are actually less happy 20 years later than non-materialists
4. True Love
* Lucas et al (2003) - are married people happier? 
    * moarried people are happier in the first year or two, but then it goes back to baseline
    * different group got this same trend in German population with this "honeymoon period"
5. Perfect Body/Face/Etc
* Jackson  et al (2014) - losing weight over a diet program
    * 3 different groups emerge: lose weight, gain weight, weigh the same
    * weight loss category - actually doubled in terms of more depression cases in the group
* Von Soest et al (2011) - cosmetic surgery in adolescents, lots more issues with depression/suicide, alcohol use, conduct problems after the surgery
* extreme changes in looks seems to reduce wellbeing
6. Good Grades
* Levine et al (2012) - if you get grad that is lower/higher than expect, how does that make you feel? scale of 1-9
    * lower grade - predicted: 4.42; actual: 6.36
    * exactly as expected - predicted: 7.81; actual: 6.45
    * higher grade - predicted: 8.27; actual: 6.55
* not statistically impactful for your overall happiness, even in the moment you find out

### Why We Have Misconceptions
All the things above are still goals that we have, but they are not moving us toward being happier.

Why aren't these things making us happy? Some fallacies we think:
* happiness is genetic/can't be changed
* bad stuff will always happen and mess things up

These answers are wrong. Lyubomirsky shows that these two reasons don't really play into happiness. 
* looked at identical twins vs fraternal twins
* life circumstances for people in "train wreck" scenarios
* 50% genetic setpoint, 10% life happens, and then 40% actions/thoughts

So we can at least control that 40% actions/thoughts, so we can work towards this part!
* "our intentional, effortful activities have a powerful effect on how happy we are, over and above the effects of our set points and the circumstances we find ourselves in." 
But instead we seem to be working towards the wrong goals in making us happier. 

Another fallacy:
* "I am an exception to the rule for this science."

### Annoying Features of the Mind

1. Our mind's strongest intuitions are often totally wrong. Sometimes the mind will give us intuitions that are just factually wrong.
    * ex: If a baseball and bat cost $1.10, and the bat cost $1 more than the ball, how much does the ball cost? 
    * most people think 10 cents, but actual is 5 cents
2. Minds are sensitive to context: think more in relative terms than global perspective. 
    * Tend to hang out with people within the context of your situation 
    * ex: grades: everyone failed, salary: hanging out with people in that same band
    * social media: what effect does this have to see "same" people doing cooler things/FOMO/continual comparison?

### Q&A Notes:
* Almost everyone is mispredicting (affective forcasting) how much they will react to something as well as the duration it will have effect on them.
* Awesome stuff: our society relies upon its people to be consumeristic/want more. In the 1940s, commericals were around but not as interruptive. Now, we are driven towards products.
* Mental health and drugs: lots of factors at work; we think more about these diagnoses, but now there is a culture about these drugs that are helping the problem but aren't necessarily making people happier overall.
